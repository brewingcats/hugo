{{< big S >}}tarting the weekend on July 27 we decided to visit the {{< link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukilteo_Light" "Mukilteo Lighthouse." >}} Surprisingly 
after being several years in the region we've never visited this lighthouse before so we decided to head over there and take a look at it

{{< big C >}}onstruction of the lighthouse began on 1905 and became operational in 1906. They used a 'revolving 
{{< link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_lens" "Fresnel lens'" >}} same that is on exhibition below along with a white bust sculpture from 
{{< link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Vancouver" "George Vancouver." >}} There were several other details on the bottom floor of the lighthouse that 
will have to wait for the next visit HugoWink We also didn't go up to the lighthouse as that day was crowded, so another day will be... ðŸ˜‰ Then we took a small 
walk on the {{< link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukilteo_Lighthouse_Park" "Mukilteo Lighthouse Park" >}} which is an easy-walk park where families get 
together that also serves as relaxation area

Here's a collection of the pictures I've taken from the area:

{{< head 2 "Boat Tour in Diablo Lake" >}}

{{< big N >}}ext day we had booked a {{< link "http://www.seattle.gov/light/damtours/diablotours.asp" "boat tour" >}} in 
{{< link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_Lake" "Diablo Lake" >}} so we jumped on the road early on Sunday. We had to drive across the 
{{< link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_Dam" "diablo dam" >}} to get to the tour. Apparently this is open just few months during summer. Once getting 
there we were able to see the beauty of the lake and its surrounding places

The beauty of the lake can be appreciated even before jumping on the boat!

{{< big S >}}peaking about the lake, check out that color! According to the boat guide the snow from the mountain as it melts takes away powder off the white rock 
and this is the reason for the lake's color. Not sure how the green came into the equation on all that, perhaps the moss on the bottom brings the tone

The boat allowed us to get pretty cool views from the lake, its colors, and how it fits in the landscape

Once in the boat everyone had plenty of chance for taking wallpaper-like pictures, here some of the ones I took:

{{< big A >}}sking around why a lake with such nice views was called `Diablo Lake` (Diablo means Devil), they told us that on the Diablo Dam area there are two 
peaks, Colonial Peak (the tallest) and Pyramid Peak. Around 1900s people started noticing as the air passed through the peaks it sounded '_as if the 
Devil was howling_' and hence this name

{{< big T >}}he guys from the boat tour let us enter the hydroelectric plant Ross Powerhouse at the {{< link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Dam" "Ross Dam," >}} 
you can see some of the pictures above. We actually saw the main rotor operating which drives the energy from the water turbine into the generator above:

After the tour a small drive to `Diablo Lake Vista Point` got us some extra snaps and this video to complete this trip
