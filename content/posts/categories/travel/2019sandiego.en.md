description: A short trip to visit for first time San Diego in 2019. Discovered some interesting places that I documented here
lang: en

{{< big A >}} simple, short trip to San Diego. A good opportunity to get to know another nice place from US. Off we go early on Saturday we got a chance to catch 
the late morning in San Diego, first walk: downtown San Diego, close to Gaslamp Quarter. Doing an initial assessment of the surroundings

{{< big M >}}y initial thought about the city was 'new meets old', I had this idea reinforced throughout the trip... new buildings next to old ones over and over. 
Wild west meets modern California and for the good it seems

After checking the downtown area for a bit is time to head out to {{< link "https://www.balboapark.org/" "Balboa Park" >}}

Once in Balboa Park we got to experience what it was once Spain‚Äôs land. The architecture tells it all, yet there‚Äôs more to say that only Spaniard influence, a 
California feeling I cannot describe

Visiting the {{< link "https://www.balboapark.org/gardens/botanical-building" "Botanical Building and Lily Pond" >}} is a must if you're in Balboa Park

{{< big A >}}nother point of interest was the {{< link "https://www.balboapark.org/shopping/spanish-village" "Spanish Village Art Center." >}} 
A good place for getting souvenirs and themed art. Another example of the remaining 
influence set by Spaniards in the form of lively colors everywhere. They also had cat paintings! üòª

{{< big N >}}ext day we tried the {{< link "https://www.trolleytours.com/san-diego" "Hop-On-Hop-Off Trolley Tours." >}} Highly recommended, you can get to know several 
interesting places without worrying about driving or finding parking. Specially when you don't plan to stay for a long time in either of those. Starting with 
{{< link "https://www.oldtownsandiegoguide.com/" "Old Town San Diego," >}} then the 
{{< link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconditional_Surrender_(sculpture)" "Unconditional Surrender Statue," >}} a stop in 
{{< link "https://www.sandiego.org/articles/downtown/gaslamp-10-fun-facts.aspx" "Gaslamp Quarter," >}} another one in 
{{< link "https://www.sandiego.org/explore/things-to-do/beaches-bays/coronado.aspx" "Coronado Beach," >}} and finally

{{< big N >}}ext day, {{< link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Jolla" "La Jolla!" >}} The top photo of this post is in La Jolla, such a beautiful place, relaxed, yet not 
abandoning the city vibe. We got to try this super cool restaurant {{< link "https://www.eatpuesto.com/" "Puesto La Jolla;" >}} you gotta try it out! Vegetarian 
options were just on point üëåüèª

{{< big N >}}ext stop was {{< link "https://www.nps.gov/cabr/index.htm" "Cabrillo National Monument," >}} nice view point. Check. Historic Site. Check. A lighthouse. 
Check! Also a must this place shows the might and ambition of the Spaniards who reached this far as the first country that reached the west coast for first 
time. From this place you can see Coronado Beach, the Naval Air Station, and even the coast of Tijuana at the very end, see the pictures below

{{< big W >}}e also visited {{< link "https://www.sandiego.org/explore/things-to-do/beaches-bays/coronado.aspx" "Coronado Beach" >}} but it was so relaxing that I 
decided to chill out instead of taking tons of pictures üòâ

There are so many things to do, and more that I couldn't include here like the amazingly vegan restaurants! Definitively on the list to visit again!
