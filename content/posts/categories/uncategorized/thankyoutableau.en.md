{{< head 1 "Thank You Tableau" >}}

{{< big A >}}lmost 6 years have passed since I joined {{< link "https://www.tableau.com/" Tableau >}} 
back in 2016. What an adventure! Amazing company, amazing coworkers, great place for learning. I had the 
responsibility of improving parts of the product (go Web Authoring!) as well as its test infrastructure. 
I worked in multiple {{< link "https://www.tableau.com/events/conference" "Tableau conferences" >}} 
(Austin, TX 2016. Las Vegas, NV 2017. Las Vegas, NV 2019) and had a lot of fun, both during the event and
after.

{{< big L >}}earned valuable lessons and new technologies outside of the Microsoft stack (new to me). 
Learned about {{< link "https://www.selenium.dev/" Selenium >}} and 
{{< link "https://www.browserstack.com/" BrowserStack >}} used in Tableau browser tests which opened a 
world of ideas for me. Prior to this I’ve never done any browser testing. Learned and contributed to 
{{< link 
  "https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2015/4/introducing-tabjolt-point-and-run-load-testing-solution-tableau-server-38604"
  TabJolt >}}, a stress engine used to benchmark Tableau deployments. Learned about 
{{< link "https://reactjs.org/" React >}} and {{< link "https://jasmine.github.io/" Jasmine >}} and their 
use in our web authoring products ({{< link "https://online.tableau.com/" "Tableau Online" >}} and 
{{< link "https://public.tableau.com/" "Tableau Public" >}}). More importantly, I learned about Tableau’s 
impact on the careers of people, business, and the environment. Data is important. Data is power. With 
power comes responsibility as well. Seeing Tableau put to use in good causes such as tracking disease 
spread, poverty, environmental impact and more gave it an additional meaning to my day-to-day work. 
Working in a place that helps the world in this way is hard to match.

{{< big H >}}ad the pleasure to work with a team of rock stars, everyone excelled in one of more field. I 
was not only able to learn from those rock stars but also bond as a team. Multiple personalities, 
multiple skills and everyone was able to work as a great team and deliver. It was just simply a very rare 
balance, something I appreciate deeply. The cherry on top was a management chain open to new ideas, to 
try and fail, to deliver and recognize, to explore new paths, technologies and processes. While all these 
factors were great I recognize that everyone is on their own path and their own career and that this 
intersection in time while great, it will change eventually as each of us progress in our careers, 
there’s no way around it. Still I feel grateful for the time I’ve spent in this team (*Move to the Web*, 
later renamed to *Stay on the Web*) and this company.

{{< big Y >}}ou got me at “Data”. Realizing the importance of good data systems has taken me on to my 
next career adventure and sadly my departure from this team and this company. I will hold great memories 
from my time here and for sure will keep in touch with the great people that crossed at some point on my 
team or the company. Empowering people and organizations to be more efficient and achieve more with their 
data {{< link "/posts/resume/" "was and will still be" >}} a focus on
