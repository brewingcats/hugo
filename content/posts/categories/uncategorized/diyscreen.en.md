{{< big G >}}etting ready for the summer! One of the things that just *needed* to be done before we 
could enjoy the company of guests in the backyard was the addition of a privacy wall in the deck. We got 
our hands dirty for few days and accomplished it! Some woodwork here, some staining there (plus few 
tools) was all we needed to call this project done. Here's how it happened.

{{< head 3 "Why a privacy screen was needed?" >}}

{{< big I >}}n 2020 a deck was added to the back of the house, the level of the deck is in line with the 
level of the floor of the house. There were two steps at the exit of the house that got covered by the 
deck. In addition to that, the level of the house is above the level of the street. The resulting deck 
ended up pretty close to the top level of the fence and thus anything can be seen entirely from the 
street.

{{< big P >}}lanning was the first step in the process. Decide how many panels are we going to fit into 
the space, find the wood for the posts and the panels. In order to preview the panel size the very first 
step is to find appropriate wood for the posts, the decision was to use 4" x 4" x 10' since it seemed to 
have the appropriate height and sturdiness for the job. {{< link

{{< big O >}}k the posts are a go. Now we need hardware to attach them. We need to consider the position 
of the posts and how to attach them to the beam on top and to the base on the lower part. The main 
consideration here is that the top part of the post will not be attached directly to the beam given the 
limitations of the post positioning (you'll realize why later). We'll need a bracket that is sturdy 
enough to support the post, the weight of the boards attached to them, and the wind forces pushing in 
both directions. Below are some of the brackets I've considered for this job. {{< link

for the top costs $6.55 (total $26.20). For the bottom I used a galvanized strap tie since it can be 
bent as desired (also included below. Two per post at 57¬¢ for a total of $4.56).

{{< carousel-rich data="diypw02" width="70%" dropdown="no" >}}

{{< big S >}}electing the boards is now the next step. First of all, these wood boards will be exposed to 
the elements and hence it needs to tolerate humidity, changes in themperature, wind, etcetera. Staining 
will be part of the process but still the wood should tolerate the elements. It is important to select 
construction grade wood that does not split either during instalation or later. Nicer wood would be a 
waste given this application. The length should be big enough to support the intended distance between 
posts and sturdy enough for this panel width. In the end this was the selected wood.

{{< carousel-rich data="diypw03" width="70%" dropdown="no" >}}

{{< big E >}}lected 1" separation between the boards, and calculating for a space on top to allow for 
light to enter reached out to a total of 16 boards per panel. Totalling 3 panels means we need a total 
of 48 boards at a price of $6.98 for an expense of $335.04. I bought few boards ahead to calculate how 
much I would need to cut from the boards.

{{< head 3 "Putting it all together" >}}

{{< big T >}}ime to install the posts. After measuring an marking the position on the top beam, the first 
step was to attach the bracket to the top of the post. The position of the beam relative to the base of 
the deck required the bracket to create a gap between the beam and the post. This gap allowed the post to 
sit as close as possible to the deck and to keep a vertical orientation of 90¬∞ relative to the 
ground. Pictures below explain it all. Once the posts were attached to the top, I bent the galvanized 
straps to fix the posts to the base of the deck. Attached brackets used {{< link

{{< big A >}}ll boards were sanded previously. The first step to install a board is to cut it to the 
right size. In order to know the right size I used two clamps, took measurements. Once cut to the right 
size we needed to drill holes and screw the board to the posts. We used {{< link

"#7 x 2 in Phillips Exterior Screws" >}} since the boards are 1 in. thick ($32.97 5lb box). In order to 
keep the gap constant we used a board section. To accelerate locating the drilling spots for each board 
I created a stencil out of other board pieces.
