      <description>Table of Contents Dust off your photo archive and put it to work! In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you how to take your photos into a basic Tableau dashboard that will have them located in a map.

We will also review options for hosting your photos in a way that can be embed-able and useful for our Tableau dashboard.</description>
