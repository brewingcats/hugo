      <description>Table of Contents Dust off your photo archive and put it to work! In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you how to take your photos into a basic Tableau dashboard that will have them located in a map. This map will show where those photos were taken allowing you to group them and see significant events by location and optionally over time
We will also review options for hosting your photos in a way that can be embed-able and useful for our Tableau dashboard.</description>
