      <description>Move to the Web Team
Thank You Tableau Almost 6 years have passed since I joined Tableau back in 2016. What an adventure! Amazing company, amazing coworkers, great place for learning. I had the responsibility of improving parts of the product (go Web Authoring!) as well as its test infrastructure. I worked in multiple Tableau conferences (Austin, TX 2016. Las Vegas, NV 2017. Las Vegas, NV 2019) and had a lot of fun, both during the event and after.</description>
